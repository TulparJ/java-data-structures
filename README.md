# Java Data Structures Practice

This repository contains all the Java practice projects I built while learning:
- Arrays  
- Linked Lists  
- Queues  
- Binary Search Trees  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Small fun apps based on real-life ideas  

Each folder represents a different topic or mini-project I completed while studying CSC130 and practicing Java on my own.
